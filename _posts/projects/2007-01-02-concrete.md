title: On the metaphysics of exposed concrete
---
1. Despite the fact that exposed concrete is designed and developed according to rational and technical arguments, seemingly irrational construction abound.

2. Exposed concrete represents the outcome of various transformation processes and metamorphoses that have left their mark (a kind of “memory” of or former states).

3. A precarious congruency exists between outer form and “inner life”. The thin surface layer of exposed concrete seldom plays the role of the iconographic mediator.

4. The quality of concrete surface characterises the building as a whole within architectural theme. It tends towards either the archaic or the abstract.

5. Form is defined as the pre-effected synthesis of various influencing factors, with technological immanence rarely correlating with cultural permanence.

6. The concrete form is relative to the internal flow of forces. The flow is interpreted either as a system in equilibrium based on constructional and spiritual factors, or as a stress model with foundations in natural science and reality.

7. Every kind of concrete shows a face.
