<h1>The Motorway is a photographic project about the construction of the Søften–Skødstrup Motorway, which is currently being built in the heart of Denmark, a bit north of Århus. The building work started in May 2005 and it is anticipated to be complete in mid 2009 if everything goes according to plan.</h1>
