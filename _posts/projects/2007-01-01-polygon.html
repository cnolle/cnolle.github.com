	<p>When an aircraft traverses any airspace, anywhere in the world, it never does so in a straight line. An aircraft navigates from one waypoint to another.</p>

	<p>This project is a document of the waypoints within the Greater London Airspace, defined as an area starting the furthest North and moving clockwise: Stansted to London City, Gatwick to Heathrow and finally ending at Luton.</p>

	<p>Each waypoint has no corresponding building, structure or even transmitter on the ground. It only exists as a five character name associated with longitude and latitude coordinates. It is a phantom.</p>

	<p>Over a two-month period fifty-four waypoints were visited situated within London Polygon by biking through the streets of London using a GPS unit for direction taped to a bicycle.</p>

	<p>This book contains photographs from each of these waypoints, positioned on the page as they relate to their associated airport, and starting the furthest North.</p>
