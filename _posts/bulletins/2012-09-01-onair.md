Earlier this summer, while the Olympics was in full swing, I was invited to take part in Graeme Miller's 'On Air' temporary radio station. Operating from the roof terrace of the Victoria & Albert Museum in South London it broadcasted obsersations for 8 days about life on Exhibition Road.

I was invited to provide live commentary on incoming Heathrow bound air traffic. It was a intense 2x1 hour sessions, we saw among other things a Royal Kuwaiti 747, Korean Cargo and ton of smaller British Airways Airbus'.

Here's a short video of Graeme introducing the project:
