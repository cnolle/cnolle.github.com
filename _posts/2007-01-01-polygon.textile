When an aircraft traverses any airspace, anywhere in the world, it never does so in a straight line. An aircraft navigates from one waypoint to another.

This project is a document of the waypoints within the Greater London Airspace, defined as an area starting the furthest North and moving clockwise: Stansted to London City, Gatwick to Heathrow and finally ending at Luton.

Each waypoint has no corresponding building, structure or even transmitter on the ground. It only exists as a five character name associated with longitude and latitude coordinates. It is a phantom.

I have visited fifty-four waypoints situated within the polygon by biking through the streets of London using a GPS unit taped onto my bicycle to pin-point my way to their location.

This book contains photographs from each of these waypoints, positioned on the page as they relate to their associated airport, and starting the furthest North.
